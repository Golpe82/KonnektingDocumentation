KONNEKTING Device Hardware Requirements

The following microcontrollers are supported:
* Atmel ATMEGA 328P, 8Mhz@3.3V / 16Mhz@5V
* Atmel ATMEGA 32u4, 8Mhz@3.3V / 16Mhz@5V
* Atmel SMART SAM D21 (SAMD21G18), 48Mhz@3.3V

Other (Arduino compatible) controllers might work as well. But don't expect that they work flawlessly without adapting our library code.
We try to keep the number of directly supported controllers short.
