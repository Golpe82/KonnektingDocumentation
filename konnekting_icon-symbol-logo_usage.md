# Overview

Currently we have two kind of logos or symbols:

* The overall KONNEKTING logo
* The logo for the device library

# Usage

You are allowed to use the "device library" logo/icon to show, that your device is using the KONNEKTING device library. 

Any other custom graphics or logo artwork may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from KONNEKTING owners.
